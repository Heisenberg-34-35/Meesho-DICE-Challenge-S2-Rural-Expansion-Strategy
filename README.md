# Meesho DICE Challenge S2: Rural User Acquisition Strategy

This repository contains my submission for the **Meesho DICE Challenge S2 (Business Track)**.

**The Challenge:** Design a new user acquisition strategy for Meesho in deep rural India (villages <10k population).

**The Core Problem:** The primary barrier is not price, but a **profound trust deficit**. Rural users fear payment fraud ("money might get stuck"), poor quality, and complex return processes.

**My Solution:** A "Phygital" (Physical + Digital) ecosystem built around a trusted, local-first model called the **"Meesho Mitra" Program**.

## 💡 Key Strategic Pillars

My strategy is built on three core ideas:

### 1. The "Trojan Horse" Target Segment

Instead of targeting all users, the strategy focuses on **"The Progressive Aspirants"**.
* **Who:** A 14-30 year-old, digitally-native segment (students, first-jobbers).
* **Why:** They act as the **"digital conduit" or "Trojan Horse"** for their families, possessing the highest digital literacy and an aspirational mindset.

### 2. The "Meesho Mitra" Program

The Mitra is a trusted local retailer or individual empowered to be the **face and operational hub of Meesho in the village**. This model solves the three key challenges:

* **Trust & Literacy:** The Mitra acts as an **Assisted Commerce Agent**, helping non-savvy users browse, order, and navigate the app.
* **Logistics:** The Mitra serves as a **Hyper-Local Hub** for final-mile delivery and as a simple Pick-Up/Drop-Off (PUDO) point.
* **Risk:** This is the key trust-builder. The Mitra is an **Instant Returns & Quality Check Point**. A user can return a product to their local Mitra, who performs a basic QC check and initiates an **instant refund on the spot**, completely eliminating the user's financial risk.

### 3. "Phygital" Go-to-Market (GTM) Strategy

* **Platform:** A vernacular-first UI, COD as default, and a "First-Trust Catalog" of familiar FMCG products.
* **Media Plan:**
    * **Physical ("Ground Assault"):** Wall paintings, local event sponsorships, and "Meesho Express" vans at *haats* and *melas* for product demos.
    * **Digital ("Air Cover"):** Hyper-local micro-influencer marketing and vernacular short-form video (Reels, Shorts).

* **Key Success Metrics:**
    * **Acquisition:** New User First Transaction Rate.
    * **Trust:** Monthly Repeat Purchase Rate.
    * **Network:** Number of Active Meesho Mitras & Mitra Net Promoter Score (NPS).
